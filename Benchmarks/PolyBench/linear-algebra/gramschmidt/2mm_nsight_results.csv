Occupancy,,,,Occupancy,WRN,This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated theoretical and measured achieved occupancy can be the result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel.
